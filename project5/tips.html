            <p>  Basically, you need basics. Whites, blacks, greys, in simple shirt styles that you can wear all day every day from day to night. Some places I love to shop for these are: H&M, Zara, Amazon (hyperlink all). With basic tops, comes basic pants. Bring any style of pants that are the most comfortable to you because you’ll constantly be moving around. Your preferred style may depend on the weather, so consider all factors. You can’t go wrong with your go to pair of jeans, clean black pants, beige & black trousers. While basics are what you should be packing the most of, you’re in Europe, and therefore you need to stand out like the proud American you are. Throw some pops of color in there, colorful button downs that can be dressed up or down. These are so incredibly easy to throw on and are the perfect addition to an outfit to make it more fun. Let’s talk jackets. You don’t want to overstuff your suitcase with because you know you’ll be bringing plenty of souvenir’s home. Bring something versatile and simple yet stylish and trendy. Think leather jacket, it can be light it can be heavy, whatever you prefer. This is the perfect staple jacket to throw on over any outfit that brings so much and doesn’t take away. Leather is very popular in Europe, and you will easily blend in whether you’re going to class or walking down the streets of Florence. For shoes, prioritize comfort over style. Sticking with the basics, bring a clean, white pair of everyday sneakers. Perhaps a pair of tall black boots as well to transition into nighttime. Something heeled. Because if there’s one thing that Europe has that we don’t, it’s height.

            <p>From my 3 months traveling through Europe, my key takeaways are basics, basics, and more basics. They are easy to find, easy to pack, affordable, and will always add up to a sleek outfit. You’ll notice the style in Europe is very simple yet elegant. Your business casual is their everyday. But with these packing tips you’ll be comfortable while also keeping up with the trends. Another thing is accessories. Accessorizing is key and will help spice up your outfits. Bring some fun classic gold jewelry (cheap of course) (amazon hyperlink), patterned bandanas to tie to bags, and sunglasses. Sunglasses make you look expensive without even trying, grab these (amazon link) and look like a local who effortlessly got dressed in the morning but looks incredibly chic. Along with sunglasses comes bags. Make sure to bring a couple small purses, black and white, and plain totes to carry your everyday essentials in. 
             With these tips you’ll maintain comfort, style, and have minimal items to travel with. </p>
