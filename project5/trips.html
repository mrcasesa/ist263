            <h2>Planning Trips</h2>

            <h5>Everything from deciding where to go, planning where to stay, how to get there, and what to do, all laid out for you!</h5>

            <p>  Let’s start with the fun part: Where do you want to go? Say you’re studying in Spain, that’s your home base, do you want to travel within Spain or venture out? When deciding this think about your timeline, how many weeks do you have abroad? You want to make sure that you fully immerse yourself in the country that you’re staying in but also go to cities that you’ve always want to experience. Form your list, converse with your friends, and pick your first destination. Let’s look at flights, do a simple google search, flights abroad tend to cheaper, but always look in advance. Airlines like EasyJet, Iberia Express, and Ryan Air were always my go to websites. Next, plan what days you want to go. Thursday night or Friday morning? Thursday nights are smart so that you have the whole day there Friday but do whatever works best with your schedule. Once you have your flight booked, time for a place to stay. My favorites were Airbnb’s over hotels because they were more cost efficient and felt way safer. Hostels are also a very cheap option but a different living style. You should determine where you want to stay mostly based on location, this way you’ll save money on transportation once you’re in the city.

              <p>Once you have a place locked down, laying out an itinerary should be your next step. I liked to do this far in advance so that you have time to book what you need to. Do your research. If you’re lazy with planning then you’ll have lazy trip, bottom line. Organize your ticket by days, then my morning, afternoon, and night. The next step is all preference. Do you like outdoor activities, indoor, sightseeing? Or are you more the type that just likes to explore and see where the day takes you? Whatever you do, the one piece of advice I have is just to plan. If you don’t plan, you’ll miss out especially for events that are extremely popular in that city. When it comes to food, google is your best friend. If there’s one thing I trust it’s restaurant reviews. Once you find those lock in the reservations because the last thing you want is to have a day full of activities and not have a reservation at a well-known restaurant in the city, you’re in waiting for you after.  When it comes to travel within European cities, walking was always the way I’d get around. But if you’re unfamiliar with the area all types of public transportation were a great option also. It was extremely easy to navigate and felt way cleaner and safer that the New York City subway. Last piece of advice is watch out for pick pocketers! Practice safe cautionary actions because something unsafe happening could ruin your whole experience. You can do way more you think you can in a 3-day weekend trip, and if you take these tips then you’ll get the most out of it.
