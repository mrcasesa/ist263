        I am a senior studying in the School of Information Studies with a concentration in digital retail strategies and web design and a minor in Marketing. I’m interested in all thing’s technology, business, and retail. Last semester, I took a break from my normal routine and studied abroad in Madrid, Spain and had the best 3 months traveling, meeting new people, and trying new things. When I got back from Madrid I worked in technology assurance, I was able to gain hands on experience and learned a lot from a great firm which I’m looking forward to continuing post-graduation. When I wasn’t working this summer, I enjoyed taking trips to the beach, going to concerts, reading, and spending time with my friends and family before we all left for our last year of college.
